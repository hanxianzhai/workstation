# problem

## project

### data

not enough way to import data, for example: host can't import from cloud computer vendor

not enough support for data nested to nested, it will cause the operator's operation not suitable

not enough clearly display data and support operator's operation, compare to grafana

### command

Did not get through the command to data, also the openness for data to command is not enough

### business

lots of operation business is fix at the production, is not easy to suit for operation

not enough openness, CMDB's data not point to distribution library,it means that so many company/group do the same work

### authority&audit

authority&audit be embedded in CMDB, from a global perspective, it means that authority&audit is so complex and difficult to manage

## atmosphere&openness

### issue

not paying enough attention to issue

### usable function

charged features are larger than free
